[h1] Custom Spawn Rates [/h1]

Custom Spawn Rates is a simple mod that lets you customize spawn rates of enemies.
Complete with a config that allows you to freely manipulate general spawn rates by raising, lowering and limiting the max spawns available. 
The spawn rate is not modified at all if the mod isn't in use either, perfect for those who only want to change the spawn rates in certain scenarios.
You may also only spawn NPCs by rarity. Looking for the ever elusive Stylist? Trying to spawn a Mimic? Try this option out by raising or lowering the rarity.

**Disclaimer** 
Max spawns in Terraria are hard coded to a limit of 200. All vanilla code expects this limit, so my mod uses it too for compatibility.
Lots of Rare Spawns are mostly influenced by player luck after the spawn rate is capped out at once per tick. 
I have hacked it in a way where the rare spawn rate increases if you set the minimum rarity in the config + spawn rate higher, but the max spawn rate for said spawns is 20x.
Going even higher would either be a lot of work or slow down the mod too much.
